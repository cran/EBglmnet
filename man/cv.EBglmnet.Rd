\title{Cross Validation (CV) Function to Determine Hyperparameters of the EBglmnet Algorithms}
\description{The degree of shrinkage, or equivalently, the number of non-zero effects selected by EBglmnet are 
				controlled by the hyperparameters in the prior distribution, which can be obtained 
				via Cross Validation (CV). This function performs k-fold CV for hyperparameter selection, and 
				outputs the model fit results using the optimal parameters. Therefore, this function runs
				\code{EBglmnet} for (\code{k x n_parameters + 1}) times. By default, EBlasso-NE tests 20
				\eqn{\lambda}s , EBEN tests an additional 10 \eqn{\alpha}s (thus a total of 200 pair of 
				hyperparameters), and EBlasso-NEG tests up to 25 pairs of (a,b).

\arguments{
  \item{x}{input matrix of dimension \code{n} x \code{p}; each row is an
  observation vector, and each column is a candidate variable. When epistasis is considered, users do not need
  to create a giant matrix including both main and interaction terms. Instead, \code{x} should always be
  the matrix corresponding to the \code{p} main effects, and \code{cv.EBglmnet} will generate the interaction terms
  dynamically during running time.}
  \item{y}{response variable. Continuous for \code{family="gaussian"}, and binary for 
  \code{family="binomial"}. For binary response variable, y can be a Boolean or numeric vector, or factor type
  array.}
  \item{family}{model type taking values of "gaussian" (default) or "binomial". } 
  \item{prior}{prior distribution to be used. Taking values of "lassoNEG"(default), "lasso", and "elastic net". 
  All priors will produce a sparse outcome of the regression coefficients; see Details for choosing priors. }  
  \item{nfolds}{number of n-fold CV. \code{nfolds} typically >=3. Although \code{nfolds}
    can be as large as the sample size (leave-one-out CV), it will be computationally intensive for large datasets. Default value is \code{nfolds=5}.}
  \item{foldId}{an optional vector of values between 1 and \code{nfolds}
    identifying which fold each observation is assigned to. If not supplied, each of the \code{n} samples will be 
	assigned to the \code{nfolds} randomly.} 
  \item{Epis}{Boolean parameter for including two-way interactions. By default, \code{Epis = FALSE}. When
  \code{Epis = TRUE}, EBglmnet will take all pair-wise interaction effects into consideration. EBglmnet does not 
  create a giant matrix for all the \code{p(p+1)/2} effects. Instead, it dynamically allocates the memory for the 
  nonzero effects identified in the model, and reads the corresponding variables from the original input matrix 
  \code{x}.}
  \item{group}{Boolean parameter for \code{group EBlasso} (currently only available for the \code{"lassoNEG"} 
  prior). This parameter is only valid when \code{Epis = TRUE}, 
	and is set to \code{FALSE} by default. When \code{Epis = TRUE} and \code{group = TRUE}, the hyperparameter
		controlling degree of shrinkage will be further scaled such that the scale hyperparameter for interaction terms
			is different with that of main effects by a factor of  \eqn{\sqrt{p(p-1)/2}}. 
			When \eqn{p} is large, eg., several thousands of genetic markers, 
			the total number of effects can easily be more than 10 millions, and \code{group EBlasso} 
			helps to reduce the interference of spurious correlation and noise accumulation.}
  \item{verbose}{parameter that controls the level of message output from EBglment. It takes values from 0 to 5; larger verbose displays more messages. 0 is recommended for CV to avoid excessive outputs. Default value for \code{verbose} is minimum message output.}
}
\details{	The three priors in EBglmnet all contain hyperparameters that control how heavy the tail probabilities are. Different values of the hyperparameters will yield different number of non-zero effects retained in the model. 
	Appropriate selection of their values is required to obtain optimal results, and CV is the most 
	oftenly used method. For Gaussian model, CV determines the optimal hyperparameter values that yield 
	the minimum square error. In Binomial model, CV calculates the mean logLikelihood in each of 
	the left out fold, and chooses the values that yield the maximum mean logLikelihood value of the k-folds.
	See \code{EBglmnet} for the details of hyperparameters in each prior distribution. \cr \cr
