\title{Empirical Bayesian Lasso (EBlasso) and Elastic Net (EBEN) Methods for Generalized Linear Models}

\description{ Fast Empirical Bayesian Lasso (EBlasso) and Elastic Net (EBEN) are generalized linear regression methods for variable selections and effect estimations. 
Similar as \code{lasso} and \code{elastic net} implemented in the package \pkg{glmnet}, \pkg{EBglmnet} features 
the capabilities of handling \eqn{p>>n} data, where \code{p} is the number of variables and \code{n} is 
the number of samples in the regression model, and inferring a sparse solution such that irrelevant variables 
will have exactly zero value on their regression coefficients. Additionally, there are several unique features in \pkg{EBglmnet}: \cr\cr
1) Both \code{EBlasso} and \code{EBEN} can select more than \code{n} nonzero effects. \cr
2) EBglmnet also performs hypothesis testing for the significance of nonzero estimates. \cr
3) EBglmnet includes built-in functions for epistasis analysis.\cr\cr
			 There are three sets of hierarchical prior distributions implemented in \pkg{EBglmnet}: \cr\cr
1) EBlasso-NE is a two-level prior with (normal + exponential) distributions for the regression coefficients.\cr
2) EBlasso-NEG is a three-level hierarchical prior with (normal + exponential + gamma) distributions.\cr
3) EBEN implements a normal and generalized gamma hierarchical prior.\cr

While those sets of priors are all "peak zero and flat tails", \code{EBlasso-NE} assigns more probability mass to the tails, resulting in more nonzero estimates having large \eqn{p}-values. In contrast, \code{EBlasso-NEG} has a third level constraint on the \code{lasso} prior, which results in higher probability mass around zero, thus more sparse results in the final outcome. Meanwhile, \code{EBEN} encourages a grouping effect such that highly correlated variables can be selected as a group.
			 Similar as the relationship between \code{elastic net} and \code{lasso}, there are two parameters \eqn{(\alpha, \lambda)} required for \code{EBEN}, and it is reduced to \code{EBlasso-NE} when parameter \eqn{\alpha = 1}. We recommend using EBlasso-NEG when there are a large number of candidate effects, using EBlasso-NE when effect sizes are relatively small, and using EBEN when groups of highly correlated variables such as co-regulated gene expressions are of interest.
 \cr \cr 
			Two models are available for both methods: linear regression model and logistic regression model. Other features in this package includes:\cr 
			* 1 *     epistasis (two-way interactions) can be included for all models/priors; \cr
			* 2 *     model implemented with memory efficient \code{C} code; \cr
			* 3 *     LAPACK/BLAS are used for most linear algebra computations. \cr \cr
			
Several simulation and real data analysis in the reference papers demonstrated that \pkg{EBglmnet} enjoys better performance than \code{lasso} and \code{elastic net} methods in terms of power of detection, 
			false discover rate, as well as encouraging grouping effect when applicable. \cr
